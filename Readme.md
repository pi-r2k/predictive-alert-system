# Predictive Patient Deterioration Alert System

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model that detects early signs of patient health deterioration using electronic health records (EHR), primarily vital signs. The goal is to alert clinicians 6–12 hours before a potential ICU admission, enabling early intervention and potentially saving lives.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict patient deterioration in advance using EHR and vital sign data.
- Compare the model’s performance against standard clinical scores like MEWS and NEWS.
- Ensure interpretability and clinical trust in model predictions.
- Build a robust system that works across different age groups, genders, and hospital settings.

## ❓ Key Questions Addressed

- How early can patient decline be predicted reliably?
- What clinical features are most predictive?
- How well does the model perform vs existing scoring systems?
- Can clinicians interpret and trust model outputs?
- How does the model perform with missing or noisy data?

## 🏥 Real-World Impact

- Reduced ICU admissions
- Shorter hospital stays
- Lower mortality rates
- Assist overloaded healthcare professionals with timely alerts
